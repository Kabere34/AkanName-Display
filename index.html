        The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the day of
        the week they were born and the order in which they were born. These
        Akan names signify the day one is born. According to Akan tradition,
        each child is born with a name associated to their soul. The day the
        child is born is therefore determined by the soul. The well thought and
        organized naming system of the Akan’s was initiated by the ancestors and
        has attracted so many people’s attention as they desire to know more
        about these names.<br />
